<img border="0" src="asset/pie1.png" alt="pie1" > 
<p> Our survey results show that DSS is the most popular choice among customers when asked which system they want to use, indicating a high demand for decision-making systems. </p> 
<img border="0" src="asset/pie2.png" alt="pie2" > 
<p> Our survey also found that only a few customers preferred to maintain their current workflow, when asked whether they would accept workflow optimization in a new system. </p> 
<img border="0" src="asset/pie3.png" alt="pie3" > 
<p> Most of our survey respondents expressed a preference for simple and familiar operation when it comes to their preferred operating system, IT equipment, and system interface. They hope that any new system will also be more user-friendly. </p>
